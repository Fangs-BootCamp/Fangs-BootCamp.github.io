# Project 2: Arithmetic Logic Unit

## E210/B441, Spring 2021 Version 2021.

## Autograder Due: 11:59pm, Friday, February 12th

## Demo Due: NO DEMO

## Overview

You will design and implement an 8-bit **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)**. You can use the same
design procedure to expand to a functionally complete 16-, or 32-bit ALU. You will also get to
implement a basic **D Flip-Flop**. Flip Flops are used to add state to your digital systems.

## Background

###### Arrays

For the last project, we expressed the d outputs of the decoder separately:
module decoder(
input a, b, c,
**output d0, d1, d2, d3, d4, d5, d6, d**
);
However, it is also possible to combine them into a single array of wires:
module decoder(
input a, b, c,
**output [7:0] d**
);
Note that the array definition is of the form:
type [mostSignificantIndex:leastSignificantIndex] name;


Thus, the big index goes on the left, and the smaller index (typically 0) on the right. _It is
possible to create arrays differing from this convention, but we do not recommend it._
Individual wires can be accessed with the standard array syntax ‚Äú[]‚Äù that you‚Äôve seen from C or
Python:
assign d[1] = ~a && ~b && c;
wire wire1 = d[0] ^ d[1];
You can also access groups of bits from within an array using the semicolon similar to Python.
For example, this will access bits 5,4, and 3 from d and assign them to bits 2,1, and 0 of
other_wire2.
wire [2:0] wire2 = d[5:3];
A few other useful array operations are concatenation and static assignment. Concatenation
lets you join multiple signals together to create an array using curly-brackets. The following
example joins three wires (a,b, and c) to make a 3-wire array wire3.
wire [2:0] wire3 = { a, b, c }; //concatenation
Static assignment let‚Äôs you fix a wire to a given logical value, for example 1. The ‚Äú ‚Äôh ‚Äú prefix is
Verilog‚Äôs method of specifying hexadecimal. Recall that C uses the ‚Äú 0x ‚Äú prefix. You can also
use ‚Äôb to specify a binary number.
wire wire4 = ‚Äôh0; // static assignment
wire [2:0] wire5 = ‚Äôb010; //also static assignment
wire [2:0] wire6 = { ‚Äôb0, ‚Äôb1, ‚Äôb0 } ; //static + concatenation
Sometimes it‚Äôs helpful to specify the number of bits for a number. You can do this by placing the
number of bits for a number ahead of the ‚Äôh. In the following example, we specify that the first
number is two bits wide, and the second number is only 1 bit wide.
wire [2:0] wire6 = { **2** ‚Äôb1, **1** ‚Äôb0 } ; // binary 01 & 1

###### Case Statements

Another piece of new Verilog for this lab is the case statement. Just like C, verilog lets you use
case statements. The syntax looks something like this:
case(sel)


```
2‚Äôb00: out = input[0]; //set out = input[0] when sel = 00
2‚Äôb01: out = input[1]; //set out = input[1] when sel = 01
2‚Äôb10: out = input[2];
2‚Äôb11: out = input[3];
default: out = input[0]; //you usually want a default case
endcase
```
###### Combinational Always Blocks

Unfortunately, you cannot use case statements with assign, it must be inside a special block
called always_comb. The comb is short for combinational. always_comb blocks look like
this:
always_comb
begin
out = **input[2]** ;
end
always_comb blocks run all of the commands between begin/end every time something on
the right-hand side of any contained equation changes. In the above block, the right-hand-side
is shown in bold. That means whenever anything changes, Verilog will re-evaluate _all_ the
block‚Äôs assignments. The above block is functionally equivalent to assign out =
input[2];
As Verilog is an odd language, and you cannot assign a value to a ‚Äòwire‚Äô inside an always block.
Therefore we declare out as a ‚Äòlogic‚Äò type. There are subtle differences between wire and
logic, but for now just remember that everything inside an always block must be declared
‚Äòlogic‚Äò.
If we put the always block and the case statement together, we get something that looks like
this:
logic out; //must be logic (or reg) for always blocks
always_comb
begin
out = 1‚Äôh0; //default
case(sel)


2‚Äôb00: out = input[0];
2‚Äôb01: out = input[1];
2‚Äôb10: out = input[2];
2‚Äôb11: out = input[3];
endcase
end
This lets us set out to one of 4 values based on the value of sel (or select). This is one way to
build a 4-1 multiplexer.

###### Flip-Flop Always Blocks

One final piece is how to build D Flip Flops in Verilog. Here again we make use of an always
block, but this one looks a little different.
wire clk, D; //input signals
logic Q, Qbar; //must be logic (or reg) for always blocks
//D Flip Flop
**always_ff @(posedge clk)**
begin
Q <= D;
Qbar <= ~D; //optional
end
Notice this always block is an always_ff, ‚Äúff‚Äù is short for ‚Äúflip-flop‚Äù. It also includes @(p
osedge clk) or ‚Äúat the positive edge of clock‚Äù. This means only the positive (rising) edge of
clk will cause signals inside the always block to change. A positive edge is when a signal
which was 0 (a low voltage) rises to 1 (a high voltage). Thus, there is a ‚Äúpositive‚Äù or ‚Äúrising‚Äù
edge in the waveform. Unless clk is rising (going from 0 to 1), none of the outputs will change.
This is what makes this block into a flip flop. As Q and Qbar can hold state, they must be
declared as logic or the older reg. Also, notice the use of the **non-blocking assignment
(<=)**. We‚Äôll discuss this more in class, but the rule is:

#### always_comb is for combinational logic and

#### ONLY USES BLOCKING ASSIGNMENTS ( = )


#### always_ff @(posedge ...) is for sequential logic and

#### ONLY USES NON-BLOCKING ASSIGNMENTS ( <= )

## DEBUGGING PAIN WILL RESULT IF YOU

## BREAK THE ABOVE RULE!!!

Verilog being an odd language, the tools will not check for this, and are more than happy to let
you do whatever you want. Then you won‚Äôt understand why your FPGA does not behave as
expected. If you get a warning that says ‚Äúinferring latch‚Äù, you broke the rule!
There are several other always blocks in Verilog. For now, we recommend you stick with the
two above.

###### Flip-Flop Always Blocks with Enable

The previous flip-flop block always updated its state on every rising edge of clk. However, often
you want to control that slightly, so that it only updates the value when you enable it. For that,
we add a little more logic to the always_ff block:
wire clk, D; //input signals
**wire e; //enable input**
logic Q, Qbar; //must be logic (or reg) to retain state
//D Flip Flop
always_ff @(posedge clk)
begin
**if (e) begin //only update if enabled**
Q <= D;
Qbar <= ~D; //optional
end
end

##### ALU


You will build an ALU that takes two inputs, a and b, and produces three outputs, r, c and v.
Additionally, another input s will select which type of operation should be performed. Your ALU
will be capable of both Arithmetic and Logical operations.

###### Arithmetic

Your ALU should be capable of both **addition** and **subtraction**. We‚Äôll assume you‚Äôve seen
digital addition before. Subtraction in the digital world can be implemented using addition and
2‚Äôs complement.
ùëü = ùëé‚àí ùëè = ùëé + ùëè+ 1
Thus, by inverting _b_ and adding 1, we can implement subtraction. Now that we are also doing
subtraction, we have chosen to express the **r** esult as _r_ rather than _s_ for sum.
There are a number of different ways to build adders. **In practice, it is typically easiest to use
the built-in Verilog addition operator (+) or subtraction operator (-) and let the tools
figure it out.** Unfortunately, Verilog‚Äôs built-in addition operator, by default, assumes an 8-bit
addition results in an 8-bit sum. However, we want the carry-out, so we need a 9-bit sum. The
solution is to prepend a 1-bit 0 to your 8-bit value to form a 9-bit value. We can use the
concatenation operator in Verilog to achieve this.
wire [7:0] a = 8‚Äôhff;
wire [8:0] a9 = { 1‚Äôh0, a}; //concatenation of inputs
wire [7:0] r;
wire r9;
{r9,r} = a9; //concatenation of outputs
Notice for a9 we‚Äôre mashing the wire declaration and the assign-ment statement together
into a single line.
In addition, your ALU should be capable of several other helpful functions:
**Transfer** : ùëü = ùëé
**Test** : ùëü = (ùëé== 0 )

###### Logic

Your ALU should also be capable of 4 basic bitwise logic operations, **AND** , **OR** , **NOT** , and **XOR**.
These are computed to all bits of a and b.


###### Operation Encoding

To select which operand your ALU should perform, you will need to read in a 4-bit ‚Äúoperation
select‚Äù value ( here named s). The mapping of s values to operations is given below.
**s Operation Result
1110** AND ùëü = ùëé & ùëè
**1101** OR ùëü = ùëé | ùëè

**1100** NOT (^) ùëü = ùëé
**1011** XOR ùëü = ùëé‚äï ùëè
**1010** Addition ùëü = ùëé+ ùëè
**1001** Subtraction ùëü = ùëé‚àí ùëè
**1000** Transfer ùëü = ùëé
**0111** Test ùëü = (ùëé== 0 )

###### Carry

Recall that 8-bit unsigned addition can result in a 9-bit sum. Therefore, the highest bit should be
returned in the c bit, short for Carry. This bit must be 0 for transfer, test and all logic operations.

###### Overflow

Additionally, signed arithmetic can result in overflows. This can occur when adding two positive
numbers, and receiving a negative result. Or when adding two negative numbers resulting in a
positive number. This overflow condition should be captured in a v bit, short for oVerflow. This
bit must be correct for addition and subtraction and is undefined for all other operations. If a
signal is undefined, you can set it to whatever you want.
SP‚Äô21: The autograder now sets c and v to 0 for all operations other than Addition or
Subtraction.
There are two ways to calculate overflow. The one discussed in class is using an XOR gate
between the carry-out and the last internal carry bit of the addition/subtraction. For an 8-bit


###### addition, this would be ùë£=ùëê. Unfortunately, if you use the Verilog subtraction

```
ùëúùë¢ùë°
```
###### ‚äïùëê

7
operator, - , you will not have a ùëê 7.
The second way is to look at both the inputs and the result. If you construct a truth table for
a[7], b[7], c[7], cout and r(esult), it will look something like this:
Inputs ALU Overflow
a[7] b[7] c[7] cout r c[7] ^ cout
0 0 0 0 0 0
**0 0** 1 0 **1 1**
0 1 0 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0 0
1 0 0 0 1 0
1 0 1 1 0 0
**1 1** 0 1 **0 1**
1 1 1 1 1 0
Recall the v = c[7] ^ cout. Which means it is true whenever c[7] and cout differ.
Notice, there are two cases above where c[7] and cout differ, highlighted in red above.
Those two cases are shown in red above. The first case occurs when a[7] == 0, b[7] ==
0, and result[7]==1. This occurs when we are adding two positive numbers, and the
result is negative. The second case occurs when a[7] == 1, b[7] == 1, and
result[7]==0. Now we are adding two negative numbers and getting a positive result. We
can write a Verilog expression to capture these two cases:
wire oVerflowAdd = ~a[7] & ~b[7] & r[7] | a[7] & b[7] & ~r[7];
Recall with subtraction that ùê¥‚àíùêµ=ùê¥+ùêµ+ 1_._ Therefore, Verilog will flip the bits of b to form
~b. It will then perform {cout,result[7]} = a[7] + ~b[7] + c[7]. As part of the
project, you will need to compute a similar overflow equation for subtraction:
wire oVerflowSubtract = ??? ;


### Assignment Description

##### 8-bit ALU

Create a Verilog file named alu.sv which defines a module as follows:
module alu(
input [7:0] a, //operand
input [7:0] b, //operand
input [3:0] s, //operation Select
output logic [7:0] r, //the Result value
output logic c, //for unsigned Carry
output logic v //for signed oVerflow
);
The logic keyword is optional and can be omitted.
Your task is to implement the ALU as per the specifications above.

##### Top-Level

Please use the following top.sv.
`timescale 1ns / 1ps
module top(
input CLK100MHZ,
input [15:0] sw, //operands a,b,s
input btnC, //
output [15:0] LED //results c,v
);
logic [7:0] a;
always @(posedge CLK100MHZ) begin
if (btnC)
a <= sw[7:0];
end


alu alu0(
.a(a),
.b(sw[7:0]),
.s(sw[11:8]),
.r(LED[7:0]),
.c(LED[8]),
.v(LED[9])
);
assign LED[15:12] = 5'b0;
endmodule
This module includes an 8-bit value that stores the value of a in flip flops.
logic [7:0] a; //a state-holding register for a
This module incorporates flip-flops that capture sw[7:0] and stores it to a[7:0] when the
btnC button is pressed. This will capture the first input (a) for the ALU and store it, allowing you
to reset sw[7:0] for the second input to the ALU (b).
You will then need to reconfigure sw[7:0] for the second input, and set the select inputs to
perform the appropriate ALU operation.
As some of the LED values are unused, we assign them to 0 (off).
_Remember to select ‚ÄúSystem Verilog‚Äù from the ‚ÄúFile Type‚Äù drop-down menu._

##### Testbench

For this project, you only need to create a testbench for your ALU. It should be named
alu_tb.sv.
_Remember to select ‚ÄúSystem Verilog‚Äù from the ‚ÄúFile Type‚Äù drop-down menu._

##### Constraints

We recommend you copy the default constraints file from here:

###### Basys3 Constraints


You will also need to reconfigure your file to align with the top-level module declaration. The
names should line up properly by default.

### Evaluation

NOTE: Due to COVID and working remotely, we will delay the demonstration portion of this
project until in-person labs resume.
The evaluation will have two steps, first submission of your source code and testbench to the
autograder. Second, you will need to synthesize your design, download it to the FPGA and do a
demonstration for the TA.

##### Autograder (100% 70%)

Log on to https://autograder.sice.indiana.edu and submit your code as per Project 1.
You should submit:
‚óè alu.sv
‚óè alu_tb.sv
‚óè top.sv

##### Demonstration (30%)

Program your FPGA with your demultiplexer and demonstrate your working system to the TA.
You will not receive full points until the TA has approved your demonstration.
